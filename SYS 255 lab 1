In this lab I created a small network using vsphere a cloud computing platform. I used this network to establish
a firewall from Opensense a open source firewall it was connected to a WAN(10.0.17.118/24) and a LAN(10.0.5.2/24)
,Opensense was configured in command prompt.
Tracert ran in command prompt with a max of 3 hops to sho packets routing from the LAN to the WAN.
Power shell was used in order to check functionality of the networks and that the host and account name were correct.
